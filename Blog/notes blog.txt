        üö© OPTIONS /register is related to the preflight request sent 
         by the browser when making a cross-origin HTTP request with certain methods or headers.

            When you make a POST request to a server from a frontend application running in a browser, the browser may send an OPTIONS request first to check if the server allows the actual request to be made. This is part of the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) mechanism.
